# 🍪 cookiemonster
cookiejar client — search

Frontend part to use in combintation with [cookiejar](https://github.com/BenMann/cookiejar).   
Cookiemonster is a minimal search client that uses cookiejar's API to make packages searchable.

:exclamation: This currently needs a re-write along the lines of this [client implementation](https://github.com/BenMann/cookiejar/blob/master/client/index.html)
